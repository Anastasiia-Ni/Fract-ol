This project is about creating a small fractal exploration program.

## Index: 
- [gallery]() contains a few *.png files generated by the program
- [inc]() contains header
- [libft]() contains the source code of my libft library, which is used in the program
- [mlx]() contains miniLibX library
- [sources]() contains the source code of the program

## Installation:
Clone repository and compile with make
```
$ git clone

$ make
```

## Usage:
Run program with this command:
`./fractol [Fractal name]`

Available fractals:
- Mandelbrot
- Julia [float][float]
- Mandelbar

#### example:
