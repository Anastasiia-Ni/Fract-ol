# Fract-ol

## About project: 

In mathematics, a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales, usually having a fractal dimension strictly exceeding the topological dimension.

This project is about creating a small fractal exploration program using a graphics miniLibx library in C.
 
The project gives the opportunity to make use of the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

## Installation:
Clone repository and compile with make
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Anastasiia-Ni/Fract-ol.git
$ cd Fract-ol
$ make
```

## Usage:
Run program with this command:
`./fractol [Fractal name]`

Available fractals:
- Mandelbrot
- Julia [float][float]
- Mandelbar

#### example:

`./fractol Mandelbrot`

`./fractol Julia -0.4 0.6`

- Use arrows keys to move across the fractal.
- Use +/- to increase/decrease iterations.
- Use o/p for zoom in/out.
- Press 0 to change color scheme.
- Press ESC or "cross" button to close.
